# Markdown-monthly
Monthly member contributions markdown files

## Purpose of this Repository
The purpose of this repository is to allow people who are unfamiliar with markdown
to practice directly in the browser. No need to understand git, only need to use the 
web interface for updating the member contributions every month. 

## Closing date
The last week of the following month will be the final date for edits for the previous month.
What this means: If you are working on February member contributions, the last date before the 
maintainers will merge it with the main website will be the last week of March. Try to notify 
the maintainers if there are changes after this date. 

## Sample markdown file
Use this file to practice your markdown without worrying about making errors in the Monthly update file. 
Also remember, any member can update the monthly file so it might change in between your visits. 
If you made a commit and accidentally deleted it in between saves, you can always go back and look at the
history to restore it. Lets see how this works. 

## Image directory
You can add the title image to this directory for the month you are working on. 
There is no need to worry about linking, just add it and tell the website maintainers
to add the images and where it located when the monthly is ready.
